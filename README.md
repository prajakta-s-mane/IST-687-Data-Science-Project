# IST-687_Project
The following project is for the Hotel-Booking cancellation prediction project. It is critical to identify the factors that are responsible for the cancellation of hotel reservations. The given dataset for this project consists different variables against cancellations. The main aim is to identify the factors that impact the cancellations and predict who will cancel based on the different factors. We have decided to use four models for the ‘IsCanceled’ variable against all the other variables given to establish a relationship. The four models are as follows:

Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Linear Regression & Multiple Regression
Apriori Algorithm
R-Part Decision Tree
